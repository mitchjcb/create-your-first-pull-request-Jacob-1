After trying out the basics of Git, my partner and I individually created repositories for the exercise. The respective repositories contained a text file.

We also added each other as a collaborator in the repository.

I used git clone to make a copy of my partner's repository in my local repository.

After committing changes to their repository (in my machine), I pushed the changes.

I made a pull request to my partner's original repository and examined my partner's pull request. Afterwards, I merged the branch.

Thank you.
